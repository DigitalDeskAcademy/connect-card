# 🤖 Next Session Handoff: Multi-Tenant Security Fixes

## 🎯 Current Mission

Fix critical security vulnerabilities in the multi-tenant architecture to prevent cross-tenant access and enforce proper role-based access control.

## 📍 Current State

- **Branch**: `fix/multi-tenant-security` (active branch)
- **Parent Branch**: `feat/multi-tenant-route-migration` (completed & pushed)
- **Status**: Security phase plan created, implementation NOT started

## ✅ Completed Work (Multi-Tenant Migration)

The `feat/multi-tenant-route-migration` branch contains completed phases 1-10 of the multi-tenant migration:

- ✅ Agency admin portal at `/agency/[slug]/admin`
- ✅ Agency learning portal at `/agency/[slug]/learning`
- ✅ Platform admin portal at `/platform/admin`
- ✅ Role-based routing in auth callback
- ✅ UserRole enum (PLATFORM_ADMIN, AGENCY_OWNER, AGENCY_ADMIN, END_USER)
- ✅ Organization-scoped data access

## 🚨 Critical Security Issues to Fix

1. **No middleware protection for `/agency/*` routes** - Any logged-in user can attempt access
2. **PLATFORM_ADMIN can access `/agency/*` routes** - Should be completely blocked
3. **UserDropdown shows incorrect navigation** - Hardcoded routes don't respect role boundaries
4. **Missing role validation at middleware level** - Only page-level protection exists

## 📋 Implementation Plan

The phase plan is located at: `docs/phase-plans/multi-tenant-security/PHASE_PLAN.md`

### Phase 1: Middleware Security Layer 🔴 CRITICAL - START HERE

- [ ] Update `middleware.ts` to validate user roles for all routes
- [ ] Block PLATFORM_ADMIN from `/agency/*` routes entirely
- [ ] Block agency users from `/platform/*` routes entirely
- [ ] Validate organization slug matches user's organization
- [ ] Add security logging for all access violations

### Phase 2: Role-Aware Navigation Components

- [ ] Create `PlatformAdminDropdown` component
- [ ] Create `AgencyAdminDropdown` component
- [ ] Create `EndUserDropdown` component
- [ ] Update `Navbar` to use role-specific dropdowns

### Phases 3-5: See PHASE_PLAN.md for remaining phases

## 🔑 Key Files to Review

- `/middleware.ts` - Currently only protects `/admin` and `/platform/admin`
- `/app/(public)/_components/UserDropdown.tsx` - Has hardcoded routes
- `/app/data/agency/require-agency-admin.ts` - Page-level protection (good reference)
- `/docs/phase-plans/multi-tenant-security/PHASE_PLAN.md` - Complete implementation plan

## 💡 Technical Context

```typescript
// Current middleware issue - doesn't check /agency/* routes
if (pathname.startsWith("/admin") || pathname.startsWith("/platform/admin")) {
  return authMiddleware(request); // Only these are protected!
}

// UserDropdown issue - hardcoded routes
<Link href="/">Home</Link> // Should be role-aware
<Link href="/platform/admin">Dashboard</Link> // Platform admin only!
```

## 🎯 First Task for Next Session

1. Read `docs/phase-plans/multi-tenant-security/PHASE_PLAN.md`
2. Start Phase 1: Update middleware.ts with role-based access control
3. Test that PLATFORM_ADMIN cannot access `/agency/*` routes
4. Test that agency users cannot access `/platform/*` routes

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- The multi-tenant migration exposed these security gaps during Phase 11 testing
- This is CRITICAL to fix before any production deployment
- The `requireAgencyAdmin()` function shows the correct pattern (but at page level)
- Need the same logic at middleware level for proper security

## 🗑️ Cleanup Reminder

When all security phases are complete, delete the phase plan:

```bash
rm -rf docs/phase-plans/multi-tenant-security
```
