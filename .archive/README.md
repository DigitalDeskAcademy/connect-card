# Archived Project Files

This folder contains completed, deprecated, or outdated project files.
These are kept for reference but are no longer actively used.

AI tools (like Claude) will skip this .archive folder since it starts with a dot.

## Structure

- `completed-phases/` - Phase plans that have been implemented
- `old-documentation/` - Outdated docs replaced by newer versions
- `deprecated-features/` - Features we decided not to implement

## Why Archive?

- Keeps project history without cluttering active documentation
- Prevents AI confusion from reading outdated information
- Maintains reference material without active maintenance
- Reduces cognitive load when navigating current documentation

## Note

Files in this folder are NOT actively maintained and may contain outdated information.
Always refer to the main `/docs` folder for current documentation.
