# Sidecar Platform - Master Implementation Plan

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-14
**Purpose**: Consolidated roadmap from MVP to production-ready B2B SaaS

---

## 🎯 Product Vision & Current State

### What Sidecar Is

- **B2B SaaS Platform** for GoHighLevel agencies
- **Problem Solved**: Agencies waste 10+ hours per client on GHL onboarding
- **Solution**: Pre-built 8-module onboarding system with progress tracking
- **Business Model**: $297/month subscription (NOT per-course pricing)

### Current State Summary

- ✅ Core platform built and functional
- ✅ Multi-tenant architecture in place
- ✅ Better Auth integrated
- ❌ Authentication flow broken (creates unlimited trials)
- ❌ Stripe integration mismatched (expects per-course pricing)
- ⚠️ Security gaps for production

## 📊 Implementation Phases Overview

### Phase Hierarchy

```
CRITICAL PATH (Must do in order):
Phase 0: Emergency Fix → Phase 1: Auth Flow → Phase 2: Data Model

PARALLEL WORK (Can do anytime after Phase 2):
Phase 3: Security → Phase 4: UI/UX → Phase 5: Production

FUTURE (After launch):
Phase 6: Scale → Phase 7: Enterprise
```

## 📊 Current Status

| Phase   | Status               | Blocking      |
| ------- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| Phase 0 | 🔴 Not Started       | Everything    |
| Phase 1 | 🔴 Not Started       | Everything    |
| Phase 2 | ⏸️ Waiting           | Needs Phase 1 |
| Phase 3 | ⏸️ Waiting           | Needs Phase 1 |
| Phase 4 | ⏸️ Can start anytime | Nothing       |
| Phase 5 | ⏸️ Waiting           | Needs 1-3     |

**Next Action**: Implement Phase 0 emergency fix immediately
