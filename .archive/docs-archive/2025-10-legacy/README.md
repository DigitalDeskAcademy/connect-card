# Archived Documentation - October 2025 Consolidation

## Archive Date

October 16, 2025

## Reason for Archival

These documents were archived as part of a documentation consolidation effort to focus on the new IV therapy clinic vertical strategy. The project has pivoted from a generic LMS/CRM to a specialized vertical SaaS for IV therapy clinics built on top of GoHighLevel.

## What Was Archived

### Superseded Planning Documents

- **LAUNCH-PLAN.md** - Original launch plan replaced by IV-THERAPY-PHASE-PLAN.md
- **PAGES_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** - UI pages already implemented
- **database-migration-plan.md** - Database migration from Learner to Contact model completed
- **refactoring-plan.md** - Component refactoring completed

### Future/Speculative Features

- **future-features/** - AI lesson automation and other speculative features (revisit after MVP)
- **course-planning/** - Course content planning (not immediate priority for IV therapy vertical)
- **ai-architecture.md** - AI architecture (moved to Phase 3 of new plan)
- **calendar-architecture.md** - Calendar integration details (part of Phase 1 now)

## Retrieval

These archived documents are preserved for historical reference. If you need to reference any of these documents:

1. They contain valuable context about past decisions
2. Some features described may be revisited after MVP launch
3. The refactoring work documented here was successfully completed

## New Direction

The project is now focused on building a simplified operations dashboard for IV therapy clinics that:

- Syncs with GoHighLevel in the background
- Provides only the features clinics need daily
- Focuses on unified inbox, appointments, and inventory
- Targets 25 clinics and $10k MRR within 14 weeks

See `/docs/IV-THERAPY-PHASE-PLAN.md` for the complete implementation roadmap.
