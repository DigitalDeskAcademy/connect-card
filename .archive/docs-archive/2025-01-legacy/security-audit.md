# Security Audit Findings - January 2025

## Overview

Security audit performed on 2025-01-20. Overall score: **75/100**

This document tracks security issues to be addressed in a dedicated security branch.

## üö® Critical Issues (Priority 1)

### 1. Missing `requireAdmin()` Function

- **Location**: `/app/api/s3/upload/route.ts`, `/app/api/s3/delete/route.ts`
- **Issue**: Using custom authentication instead of consistent pattern
- **Risk**: Authorization bypass potential
- **Fix**: Create proper `requireAdmin()` function matching `requireAgencyAdmin()` pattern

### 2. Console Logging in Production

- **Locations**:
  - `/lib/auth.ts:73-77` - OTP codes logged
  - `/middleware.ts:62` - Organization slug attempts logged
- **Issue**: Sensitive data exposed in logs
- **Fix**: Remove all console.log/warn statements, use proper logging

### 3. CSRF Protection Disabled in Development

- **Location**: `/lib/auth.ts:64-66`
- **Issue**: `disableCSRFCheck: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"`
- **Fix**: Ensure always enabled in production

## ‚ö†Ô∏è High Priority Issues (Priority 2)

### 4. Inconsistent Error Messages

- **Issue**: Mix of generic and specific error messages
- **Risk**: Information disclosure
- **Fix**: Standardize all error responses to generic messages

### 5. File Upload Security

- **Issues**:
  - No file size limits at API level
  - Basic MIME type checking only
  - Simple string matching for placeholder detection
- **Fix**: Add comprehensive validation

### 6. Multi-Tenant Boundaries

- **Areas to review**:
  - Lesson/chapter operations need additional org checks
  - File path validation for org slugs
  - Rate limiting fingerprints for multi-tenancy

## ‚úÖ What's Working Well

- **Strong points**:
  - Excellent multi-tenant architecture with `organizationId` filtering
  - Prisma ORM preventing SQL injection
  - Good Zod schema validation
  - Arcjet rate limiting properly implemented

## üìã Action Items for Security Branch

```bash
# Create security branch when ready
git checkout -b security/audit-fixes-jan-2025
```

### Implementation Order:

1. Fix authentication patterns (requireAdmin)
2. Remove console logging
3. Standardize error messages
4. Add file upload validation
5. Review CSRF settings
6. Strengthen multi-tenant boundaries

### Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Test all admin routes with different roles
- [ ] Verify no console output in production build
- [ ] Test file upload limits and validation
- [ ] Attempt cross-tenant access (should fail)
- [ ] Verify error messages don't leak info

## Notes

- Current branch focus: Agency course management and placeholder system
- Security fixes will be addressed in dedicated branch
- No immediate security risks that would prevent current branch deployment
