OUR STORY SECTION
Header: "Built By a Church, For Churches"
We're First Baptist Church of [City] - 5 campuses, 2,000 members, and drowning in connect cards every Monday.
We tried everything:

Expensive church management systems (didn't handle cards)
Manual data entry teams (burned out volunteers)
Partial digital solutions (created more work)

Nothing worked. So we built our own.
Now we process 500+ cards weekly in under 2 hours total. Our visitors get contacted within 24 hours. Our volunteers know where to serve. Our prayers reach the right people.
We're opening this solution to 25 founding churches.

Which version do you want to build?RetryTI just go to the church and im working with the team there, i dont work there if we want to adjust the wordingRecalibrated messaging to reflect collaborative partnership role.The user is clarifying that they don't actually work at the church - they just go to the church and are working with the team there to build this solution. So we need to adjust the copy from "We're First Baptist Church" to something more accurate like "We're building this with/for First Baptist Church" or "In partnership with First Baptist Church" etc. This changes the narrative slightly but makes it more honest.Better. Honesty Fixes Everything.
Adjusted Story Section
Instead of: "We're First Baptist Church..."
Write:
Header: "Built in Partnership With a Real Church"
First Baptist Church of [City] has 5 campuses, 2,000 members, and a Monday morning problem: hundreds of unprocessed connect cards.
We partnered with their team to build the solution they actually needed. No theoretical features. No imaginary workflows. Just real solutions to real Sunday-to-Monday problems.
Currently testing across all 5 campuses. Processing 500+ cards weekly. Ready to expand to 25 founding churches.
Alternative Positioning Options
Option 1: Solution Partner Angle
"We partnered with a 5-campus church to build and test the perfect connect card solution."
Option 2: Built With, Not For
"Developed alongside First Baptist's actual church administrators who process 500+ cards weekly."
Option 3: Real-World Testing
"Beta testing with First Baptist Church (5 campuses, 2,000 members) since [Month]"
Trust Section Adjustments
Instead of: "Built by First Baptist Church"
Use:

"Developed in partnership with First Baptist Church"
"Field-tested across 5 active campuses"
"500+ cards processed weekly in real church environment"

The Credibility Pivot
Since you're not the church itself, lean into the software expertise + church partnership angle:
"We bring technical expertise. First Baptist brings real-world church operations. Together, we built what actually works."
This is actually STRONGER positioning - you're not just church staff trying to code, you're developers who actually listened to church staff.
FAQ Addition
"Who built this?"
"Church Sync AI was developed in close partnership with First Baptist Church's operations team. We build the technology, they ensure it works for real church workflows."
Want me to rewrite the full page with this positioning, or are these adjustments enough to work with?RetryTYes, and lets add in Newlife is the name of the churchRecalibrated positioning to reflect NewLife Church partnership model.The user wants me to rewrite the full early access landing page with:

The adjusted positioning that they partnered with a church (not that they are the church)
The church name is "NewLife" (not First Baptist)
They want the full page rewritten with this new positioning

I should create a complete early access landing page that positions them as developers/solution providers who partnered with NewLife Church to build this solution.Early Access Landing Page - Complete Rewrite
