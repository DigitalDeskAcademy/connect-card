# Why We Exist

## The Problem

Every Sunday, churches across the country experience a painful reality: visitors fill out connect cards expressing genuine interest—in volunteering, in prayer, in community—and then... nothing happens.

**The numbers are brutal:**

- 70% of first-time visitors never return
- Connect cards sit in a pile for days (or weeks)
- Manual data entry takes 5-10 hours per week
- Follow-up is inconsistent, if it happens at all

**The human cost:**

- A single mom writes "I need prayer for my sick child" and waits days for anyone to acknowledge it
- A young professional checks "I want to volunteer" and never hears back
- A family visits three times, never gets a follow-up, and drifts to another church

Churches aren't failing because they don't care. They're failing because they're drowning in manual processes.

## What We Believe

**Every visitor deserves a response within 24 hours.**

Not because it's good business. Because it's the right thing to do.

When someone walks into a church and says "I need prayer" or "I want to help"—that's a moment of courage. They're reaching out. The church's job is to reach back.

We exist to make sure that happens.

## Our Role

We're not building another church management system. The world has enough of those.

We're building a **bridge**—from the moment someone fills out a connect card to the moment they're connected to the right person, ministry, or resource.

**What we do:**

- Turn paper into data (AI-powered card scanning)
- Turn data into action (automated follow-up workflows)
- Turn action into connection (routing to the right people)

**What we don't do:**

- Replace Planning Center, Breeze, or other ChMS platforms
- Try to be everything to everyone
- Charge churches more than they can afford

## The Moment That Matters

Imagine this:

> Sunday afternoon. A volunteer leader gets a text: "Hi Jane! Sarah just signed up to volunteer in Kids Ministry. She's a teacher and excited to help. Here's her contact info. She's expecting to hear from you."
>
> Jane calls Sarah that evening. By Wednesday, Sarah has completed her background check. By next Sunday, she's serving.
>
> That same Sunday, someone wrote a prayer request about their marriage. Within hours, a prayer team member reaches out. Not a mass email. A personal message.

**That's why we exist.**

Not to build software. To make moments like that the norm instead of the exception.

## Our Commitment

1. **Churches first.** We build what churches need, not what's trendy.
2. **Simplicity over features.** If it takes training to use, we've failed.
3. **Affordable access.** Small churches deserve good tools too.
4. **Privacy matters.** Prayer requests and personal data are sacred. We treat them that way.
5. **We're a bridge, not a destination.** We help churches connect visitors to community. The community is what matters.

## The Future We're Building

A world where no connect card goes unanswered.

Where churches spend time on people, not paperwork.

Where visitors feel seen, heard, and welcomed—because the systems work _for_ the church, not against it.

That's why we exist.
