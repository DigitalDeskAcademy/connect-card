### 🟣 connect-card - MVP Fine-Tuning

**Branch:** `feature/connect-card`
**Focus:** Async processing and deduplication enhancements

**Open PR:**

- 🔄 PR #90 - Async card processing with background queue (awaiting review)
  - Cards process in background while staff continues scanning
  - Real-time progress stats display
  - Queue drawer showing all card statuses
  - Session recovery for interrupted scans

**Recently Completed:**

- ✅ PR #84 - Two-sided card extraction + dev test page (Dec 22)
- ✅ PR #83 - Phone wizard UX enhancements (Dec 22)
  - Progress header showing card count during scanning
  - Any team member can scan (removed admin restriction)
  - Card type syncs from QR modal to phone
  - Simplified QR modal with direct CTA to review queue

**What to Build:**

| Task                                       | Status     |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Async scan processing (background queue)   | [x] PR #90 |
| Two-sided card extraction                  | [x]        |
| Deduplication enhancement (fuzzy matching) | [x]        |
| Shared email detection (couples)           | [ ]        |
| "Merge with existing" vs "Create new" UI   | [ ]        |
| Upload UX improvements for non-tech staff  | [x]        |
| Better progress feedback during processing | [x]        |

**Shared Email Issue (Couples):**

> Older couples often share a single email address. Current system treats email as unique identifier,
> so husband and wife get merged into one ChurchMember record. Planning Center handles this with
> a Household model (multiple people per email).
>
> **Current behavior:** Second person with same email auto-links to first person's record
>
> **Options to fix:**
>
> - Quick: "Create as separate person" override button when name differs significantly
> - Proper: Household model with primary contact + additional members
> - Export: Ensure both people sync to Planning Center as separate entries

**Wishlist:**

- [ ] Bulk re-process failed cards
- [ ] Card template customization
- [ ] Multi-language support

### 🟢 volunteer - Event Tracking

**Branch:** `feature/volunteer-management`

**Implementation Plan:** `/docs/features/volunteer/events-implementation-plan.md`

**Recently Completed:**

- ✅ PR #89 - Events UI with toolbar, filtering, and card views (Dec 24)
  - Events list page with card-based layout
  - Reusable Toolbar component (search, view toggle, filters)
  - Event creation dialog with multi-session support
  - Event detail page with assignment modal
  - Date period filtering (Upcoming/Past/This Week/This Month)

**Implementation Phases:**

| Phase | Name                    | Description                                                | Status         |
| ----- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| 0     | Schema Preparation      | Add VolunteerEvent, EventSession, EventAssignment models   | ✅ Complete    |
| 1     | Core Event CRUD         | Create/edit/delete events, events list page                | ✅ Complete    |
| 2     | Assignment System       | Direct assign + invite pool, volunteer selection modal     | 🔨 In Progress |
| 3     | GHL SMS Automation      | Invite via SMS, parse YES/NO responses, auto-confirm       | [ ] Pending    |
| 4     | Attendance Confirmation | Magic link for leader to confirm attendance                | [ ] Pending    |
| 5     | Reliability Score       | Calculate & display volunteer reliability (attended/total) | [ ] Pending    |
| 6     | Polish & Edge Cases     | Cancel flow, archive old events, filters, empty states     | [ ] Pending    |

**Phase 2 Tasks (Current):**

| Task                            | Status |
| ------------------------------- | ------ |
| EventAssignment model           | [x]    |
| Invite pool query (all filters) | [x]    |
| Invite modal UI                 | [x]    |
| Direct assign action            | [x]    |
| Assignment status display       | [ ]    |
| slotsFilled calculation         | [ ]    |
| Send invite SMS action          | [ ]    |

**Key Design Decisions:**

- Staff dips in, takes action, leaves - system handles everything between
- SMS automation via existing GHL integration
- Optimistic attendance (auto-confirm, staff marks no-shows)
- NOT building: full scheduling, shifts, recurring availability (Planning Center's job)

- ✅ Volunteer onboarding MVP: Auto-send welcome email, BG check confirmation, review workflow
- ✅ Volunteer CRUD, pipeline, export tracking
- ✅ GHL integration for SMS/email automation
