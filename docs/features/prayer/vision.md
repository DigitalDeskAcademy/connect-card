## 🚨 Assigned Fixes (BLOCKING Feature Completion)

**These issues are assigned to this worktree. Feature is unusable until complete.**

### 1. Server Actions (CRITICAL - 35% of feature)

**Impact:** Users cannot create, edit, assign, or complete prayers
**Risk:** Feature is display-only, no functionality

**Required Actions:**

| Action                | File                        | Status          |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------- |
| `createPrayerRequest` | `/actions/prayer-requests/` | [ ] Not started |
| `updatePrayerRequest` | `/actions/prayer-requests/` | [ ] Not started |
| `assignPrayerRequest` | `/actions/prayer-requests/` | [ ] Not started |
| `markAnswered`        | `/actions/prayer-requests/` | [ ] Not started |
| `deletePrayerRequest` | `/actions/prayer-requests/` | [ ] Not started |

**Each action must include:**

- Zod validation schema
- Arcjet rate limiting
- Multi-tenant `organizationId` scoping
- Privacy checks for private prayers

---

### 2. UI Components (Depends on Server Actions)

| Component            | Status          |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| Create prayer form   | [ ] Not started |
| Assignment dialog    | [ ] Not started |
| Detail view dialog   | [ ] Not started |
| Edit form            | [ ] Not started |
| Mark answered dialog | [ ] Not started |

---

### 3. Performance: N+1 Query Fix

**File:** `lib/data/prayer-requests.ts:228-300`
**Impact:** 8 sequential COUNT queries = 400ms minimum latency
**Risk:** Slow dashboard

**The Fix:** Replace 8 COUNT queries with single GROUP BY query.

**Status:** [ ] Not started

---

## 📊 Fix Progress

| Priority | Issue              | Status | PR  |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------ | --- |
| 1        | Server Actions (5) | [ ]    | -   |
| 2        | UI Components (5)  | [ ]    | -   |
| 3        | N+1 Query          | [ ]    | -   |

**Overall:** 65% → Target 100%

## 🎯 Product Vision

### The Problem

Churches collect prayer requests via connect cards but have no organized way to:

- Track requests from submission to completion
- Assign requests to prayer team members
- Follow up on answered prayers
- Maintain privacy for sensitive requests

### The Solution

Simple prayer request management integrated with connect card workflow:

**Primary Source (70-80%):** Connect cards → AI extraction → Auto-create prayers
**Secondary Source (20-30%):** Manual entry for phone/email submissions

### Success Criteria

- ✅ All connect card prayers automatically tracked
- ✅ Simple manual creation for edge cases (phone, email, urgent)
- ✅ Privacy controls (public vs private)
- ✅ Assignment workflow (staff → team member)
- ✅ Answered prayer tracking

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Database Schema

```prisma
model PrayerRequest {
  id             String              @id
  organizationId String              // Multi-tenant isolation
  locationId     String?             // Multi-campus support

  // Request details
  request        String              // Prayer text (2000 char max)
  category       String?             // Auto-detected: Health, Family, Salvation, etc.
  isPrivate      Boolean             // Privacy control
  isUrgent       Boolean             // Priority flag

  // Source tracking
  connectCardId  String?             // Link to connect card (null for manual)
  submittedBy    String?             // Person's name
  submitterEmail String?             // For follow-up
  submitterPhone String?             // For follow-up

  // Workflow
  status         PrayerRequestStatus // PENDING, ASSIGNED, PRAYING, ANSWERED, ARCHIVED
  assignedToId   String?             // Assigned team member
  followUpDate   DateTime?           // Scheduled follow-up
  answeredDate   DateTime?           // When answered
  answeredNotes  String?             // Testimony

  createdAt      DateTime
  updatedAt      DateTime
}
```

### Privacy Model

- **Public**: All staff can see (default)
- **Private**: Only assigned team member + admins can see
- **Auto-detection**: Sensitive keywords → auto-mark private
- **Manual override**: Staff can change privacy

### Multi-Tenant Scoping

- Filter by `organizationId` (church isolation)
- Filter by `locationId` (multi-campus support)
- Staff see only public + assigned private requests
- Admins see all requests

---

## 🚀 Feature Scope

## 📋 Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Server Actions (NEXT - Critical)

**Goal:** Enable CRUD operations from UI

**Tasks:**

1. Implement 5 server actions (create, update, assign, mark-answered, delete)
2. Add Zod validation schemas
3. Add Arcjet rate limiting
4. Multi-tenant isolation checks

**Deliverables:**

- Functional create/edit/delete operations
- Assignment workflow working
- Privacy controls enforced

---

### Phase 2: Simple Manual Creation

**Goal:** Basic form for phone/email prayer submissions

**Tasks:**

1. Create simple form (name, request text, privacy toggle)
2. Dialog wrapper with "New Prayer Request" button
3. Success/error handling with toast
4. Table refresh on success

**Deliverables:**

- Staff can manually create prayers
- Simple, fast workflow
- No complex fields (keep minimal)

**Hold for Church Feedback:**

- Email submission workflow
- Phone intake process
- Advanced categorization
- Follow-up automation

---

### Phase 3: Assignment & Completion

**Goal:** Complete prayer lifecycle workflow

**Tasks:**

1. Assignment dialog (select team member, add notes)
2. Detail view dialog (full request, edit capability)
3. Mark as answered (testimony textarea)
4. Assignment history tracking

**Deliverables:**

- Full assignment workflow
- Answered prayer tracking
- Team member workload visibility

---

### Phase 4: Connect Card Integration

**Goal:** Auto-create prayers from connect card review

**Tasks:**

1. Modify connect card review action
2. Extract `extractedData.prayerRequest`
3. Create PrayerRequest with `connectCardId` link
4. Privacy auto-detection
5. Category auto-detection

**Deliverables:**

- 70-80% of prayers automated
- Manual review only for exceptions
- Privacy respected automatically

---

## 🚫 Out of Scope (For MVP)

**Not building (defer to Phase 5+):**

- ❌ Prayer batch grouping (no batching needed)
- ❌ Prayer team management (use existing team roles)
- ❌ Bulk operations (CRUD operations are individual)
- ❌ Advanced reporting/analytics
- ❌ Prayer wall (public display)
- ❌ Export to PDF/email
- ❌ GHL SMS notifications
- ❌ Follow-up automation workflows

**Rationale:** Ship simple MVP first, add complexity based on church feedback.

## 📊 Key Metrics

**Current Status:**

- Database: ✅ Complete
- UI: ✅ Complete
- E2E Tests: ✅ Complete
- Server Actions: ❌ Not started (BLOCKING)
- Connect Card Integration: ❌ Not started

**Overall Completion:** 65%

## 🔄 Workflow Example

### Scenario 1: Connect Card Prayer (Automated)

```
Sunday service
  → Visitor fills connect card with prayer request
  → Staff scans card
  → AI extracts prayer text
  → Auto-creates PrayerRequest (connectCardId linked)
  → Privacy auto-detected
  → Category auto-assigned
  → Appears in prayer table
  → Staff assigns to team member
  → Team member prays, marks answered
```

**Staff effort:** 30 seconds (assign only)

---

### Scenario 2: Phone Call Prayer (Manual)

```
Monday morning
  → Church office receives call: "Pray for my mom's surgery"
  → Staff clicks "New Prayer Request"
  → Enters: Name, request text
  → Toggles privacy if sensitive
  → Submits
  → Assigns to prayer team member
  → Team member prays, marks answered
```

**Staff effort:** 2 minutes (manual entry)

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

**We've succeeded when:**

1. ✅ 80%+ of prayers come from connect cards (automated)
2. ✅ Staff can manually create prayers in <2 minutes
3. ✅ Privacy controls prevent accidental public exposure
4. ✅ Team members can see only their assigned prayers
5. ✅ Answered prayers are tracked with testimonies
6. ✅ Multi-campus churches can filter by location

## 🎓 Design Principles

### 1. Simplicity Over Features

- **Individual prayers**, not batched
- **Simple table**, not complex dashboards
- **Basic CRUD**, not advanced workflows
- Ship fast, enhance based on feedback

### 2. Privacy First

- **Default public**, explicit private
- **Auto-detect** sensitive keywords
- **Staff permissions** enforced
- **Private → assigned only** strict isolation

### 3. Multi-Source Support

- **Primary:** Connect cards (automated)
- **Secondary:** Manual entry (fallback)
- **Both supported**, clean UX for each

### 4. Multi-Tenant Architecture

- **Organization isolation** (church data never leaks)
- **Location filtering** (multi-campus support)
- **Role-based access** (staff vs admin permissions)
