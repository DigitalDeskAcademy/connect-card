# Connect Card Management - Product Vision

**Status:** ✅ **FEATURE COMPLETE** - Ready for Production Testing
**Current Phase:** Phase 3.5 Complete - Mobile Camera Wizard + Duplicate Detection
**Worktree:** `/church-connect-hub/connect-card`
**Branch:** `feature/connect-card`
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-03

### Recent Work (Dec 2025)

- ✅ **Fuzzy Duplicate Detection** - Checks ChurchMember table, email as strong identifier
- ✅ **80% Confidence Threshold** - Don't bother reviewer with OCR errors
- 🔄 **S3 Org-Scoped Paths** - `organizations/{slug}/connect-cards/{YYYY-MM}/`

---

## ✅ Completed Fixes (Nov 2025)

**All critical issues resolved.**

### 1. Race Conditions in Batch Creation ✅

**File:** `lib/data/connect-card-batch.ts:80-118`
**Fix:** Added Prisma interactive transaction with Serializable isolation level to prevent concurrent batch creation.

---

### 2. Raw Images in Review Queue ✅

**File:** `review-queue-client.tsx`, `upload-client.tsx`
**Fix:** Added native lazy loading (`loading="lazy"`, `decoding="async"`) to all images. Next.js Image incompatible with react-medium-image-zoom and blob URLs.

---

### 3. Dashboard Fetches ALL TIME Data ✅

**File:** `lib/data/connect-card-analytics.ts:86-114`
**Fix:** Replaced unbounded query with bounded 4-week window. Uses COUNT query for today's total. Legacy fields use 4-week totals (will be refined as stats requirements solidify).

---

### 4. Cards Not Removing After Save ✅

**File:** `review-queue-client.tsx`
**Fix:** Changed `cards` from static prop to local state (`useState(initialCards)`). After save/discard, card is filtered out of local state immediately. Redirects to batches when all cards processed.

---

### 5. Removed "Approve All" Button ✅

**File:** `review-queue-client.tsx`
**Fix:** Removed "Approve All" button to prevent staff from skipping review. AI extraction is 60-85% accurate - human review is required for data quality. Digital cards (future) may allow bulk approval.

---

### 6. Simplified Batch List UI ✅

**File:** `batches-client.tsx`
**Fix:** Removed filter buttons (All/Pending/Completed) - unnecessary clutter. Badge on tab shows pending count. Staff just needs to see and review batches.

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

Churches manually enter connect card data (visitor info, prayer requests), which is:

- **Slow**: 3-5 minutes per card (staff time wasted)
- **Error-prone**: Typos in emails/phones prevent follow-up
- **Inconsistent**: Cards get lost, data entry delayed weeks
- **Poor visitor experience**: Visitors feel forgotten when follow-up is slow

**Real-World Impact:** A church processing 100 connect cards per month spends 8-10 hours on manual data entry. Manual processes lead to 30-40% of first-time visitors never receiving follow-up.

---

## ✅ Our Solution: AI-Powered Connect Card Scanning

**Workflow:** Scan → Extract → Review → Save

1. **Scan**: Church staff photograph connect cards with phone camera (iOS/Android)
2. **Extract**: Claude Vision AI extracts structured data from handwriting (60-85% accuracy)
3. **Review**: Staff review flagged cards in queue, correct AI errors (30-second review vs 5-minute manual entry)
4. **Save**: Data flows to member database, triggers follow-up workflows

**Time Savings:** 90% reduction in data entry time (5 min/card → 30 sec/card)

---

## ✅ Mobile Camera Wizard (Phase 3.5) - COMPLETE

**Status:** Complete
**Goal:** Bank-deposit-style mobile camera wizard for scanning physical connect cards

### Features Implemented

- **Live viewfinder** using getUserMedia API (in-app camera)
- **Step-by-step capture** with accept/retake for each image
- **Two-sided card support** - Front + back captured as single unit
- **Background processing queue** - Scan continuously while cards process
- **Auto-crop to card bounds** - Captures only the card area, not surrounding area
- **Real-time progress indicator** - Shows processing/complete/failed counts
- **Failed card retry** - Retry or remove failed cards from queue
- **Session persistence** - Resume interrupted scanning sessions

### Technical Implementation

#### Background Queue Architecture

Instead of blocking after each capture, cards are queued and processed in background:

```
Capture → Add to Queue → Immediately capture next card
                ↓
         Background processor uploads + extracts + saves
                ↓
         Progress indicator updates in real-time
```

#### Camera Crop Feature

The `useCamera` hook supports cropping to card bounds:

- Crops to the 85% width, 3:2 aspect ratio card alignment guide
- Removes surrounding area from captured images
- Cleaner images for AI extraction and demo presentations

#### Files Created

- `app/church/[slug]/admin/connect-cards/scan/page.tsx` ✅
- `app/church/[slug]/admin/connect-cards/scan/scan-wizard-client.tsx` ✅
- `hooks/use-camera.ts` ✅

#### Files Modified

- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added backImageKey, backImageHash ✅
- `lib/zodSchemas.ts` - Added back image fields ✅
- `app/api/connect-cards/extract/route.ts` - Handles two images ✅
- `actions/connect-card/save-connect-card.ts` - Accepts back image ✅
- `lib/data/connect-card-review.ts` - Added backImageUrl ✅
- `review-queue-client.tsx` - Front/back toggle button ✅
- `next.config.ts` - Fixed Permissions-Policy for camera access ✅

### Known Limitations / Future Improvements

- **Bulk upload pairing** - Currently bulk upload treats each file as separate card. Future: detect front/back pairs by filename convention or AI matching
- **Camera crop accuracy** - Crop calculation assumes card is centered in guide. Works well for demos but may need refinement for production use
