# Church Connect Hub

**What we do, how we do it, and why it matters.**

---

## Why We Exist

I've filled out connect cards at churches. Cards that said "I want to volunteer" or "Please pray for my family member with cancer."

I genuinely wanted to connect. I wanted to serve. I wanted to know someone heard me.

But follow-up is hard. Churches are stretched thin—small staffs, big hearts, endless demands. A stack of handwritten cards sits on a desk while Sunday happens again, and again. By the time someone gets to my card, weeks have passed. The moment is gone. I've moved on, wondering if anyone noticed I was there.

I don't blame the church. I've seen how hard they work. But I remember how it felt—that gap between wanting to connect and not hearing back. Friends have told me the same story.

**That's why we built this.**

We saw an opportunity—AI can finally read handwriting, automation can send messages instantly. But the reason we're building _this_ and not something else? Because we've been on the other side of that card. We know what it feels like to reach out and wait. And we know churches want to follow up—they just need a better way.

### What We Believe

**Every person who fills out a connect card is reaching out.**

They're saying: _I want to be part of this. I need prayer. I want to help._ That's a moment of vulnerability and hope. When churches lose that card in a pile, miss the follow-up, or take weeks to respond—that person feels invisible.

**Churches lose 70% of first-time visitors.** Not because those visitors didn't want to come back. Because no one followed up. No one made them feel seen.

**We believe that's preventable.**

Churches aren't dropping the ball because they don't care. They're drowning in administrative work. Staff spend 5-10 hours a week typing handwritten cards into spreadsheets. By the time they get to follow-up, weeks have passed. The moment is gone.

**We believe churches deserve tools that match their mission.**

They have limited tech resources. They can't build custom software. They get left behind while the administrative burden grows. Meanwhile, AI can now read handwriting. Automation can send welcome messages instantly. The technology exists—churches just need someone to build it for them.

### The World We're Building Toward

**No one feels forgotten after visiting a church.**

The visitor who checks "I want to volunteer" gets a welcome message that day—not three weeks later. The person who writes a prayer request about their mother's cancer gets acknowledgment that someone read it, that it was prayed over. The first-time guest who nervously filled out a card gets a genuine follow-up that says _we noticed you, and we're glad you came._

**Churches grow healthier, not just bigger.**

When the administrative burden disappears, staff get to do what they're called to do—ministry. Connecting with people. Following up personally. Building community. Instead of typing names into spreadsheets, they're having conversations with the people those names represent.

## What We Do

**We turn handwritten connect cards into engaged church members through AI-powered data extraction and automated follow-up.**

One sentence. That's the product.

## How We Do It

### The Workflow: Scan → Extract → Review → Save → Automate

```
SUNDAY                          MONDAY (Staff)                      RESULT
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Visitor fills              AI reads                        Same-day
connect card    →    handwriting with     →   Staff reviews   →   follow-up
(handwritten)        60-85% accuracy          and corrects        + clean data
                                              in 30 seconds       exported to
                                                                  church software
```

**Time savings: 90%** (5 minutes per card → 30 seconds per card)

### 1. AI-Powered Connect Card Scanning

Staff photograph connect cards with their phone. Our AI (Claude Vision) extracts structured data from handwriting:

- Names, emails, phone numbers
- Prayer requests
- Volunteer interests
- Campaign keywords ("I was impacted", etc.)

The AI handles the tedious reading. Staff just verify and correct.

### 2. Smart Deduplication

Before data goes anywhere, we catch duplicates:

- Fuzzy name matching (Bob = Robert, typo tolerance)
- Shared email detection (couples)
- "This person already exists" alerts

**Our pilot church's reaction:** _"Deduplication is the biggest selling point."_

One church had 20,000 database entries but only 10,000 unique people. Half their database was duplicates. We fix that.

### 3. Volunteer Onboarding Automation

When someone checks "I want to volunteer":

1. System sends welcome SMS + email with ministry documents
2. Background check link included (if required)
3. Volunteer self-reports completion
4. Staff verifies with one click
5. Ready for scheduling

**Result:** 80% volunteer completion rate vs. 30-40% with manual processes.

No more cards sitting on desks. No more interested volunteers never hearing back.

### 4. Export to Church Software

Clean, deduplicated data exported to:

- Planning Center (CSV or direct API sync)
- Breeze
- Any system that accepts CSV

Staff click "Export" and their church management system gets clean data—no re-typing.

## The Problem in Numbers

| The Reality                           | Before Us        | With Us       |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| **Staff time per week**               | 5-10 hours       | 30-60 minutes |
| **Follow-up timing**                  | 1-3 weeks        | Same day      |
| **First-time visitor follow-up rate** | ~30%             | 95%+          |
| **Duplicate records**                 | 50%+ of database | <10%          |
| **Volunteer inquiry → completion**    | 30-40%           | 80%+          |

**The cost of the status quo:**

- 70% of first-time visitors never return
- Volunteer inquiries go cold
- Prayer requests go unacknowledged
- Staff burn out on admin instead of ministry

---

## Who We Serve

**Churches with 100-5,000 members** who:

- Collect paper connect cards weekly
- Use Planning Center, Breeze, or similar church software
- Have staff spending hours on data entry
- Want visitors to feel welcomed, not forgotten

**Especially:** Multi-campus churches (3-10 locations) where the administrative burden multiplies.

---

## What We're NOT

We are **not** a church management system (ChMS).

We don't replace Planning Center, Breeze, or CCB. We make them better by:

- Getting **cleaner data** into their system
- Saving **staff time** on the data entry they already do
- Enabling **faster follow-up** that their workflows need

**Our position:** We're the bridge between the physical world (paper cards) and the digital world (clean database).

---

## The ROI

**Dollar impact for a typical church:**

- 10 hours/week × 52 weeks × $15/hour = **$7,800/year in labor saved**
- Monthly cost: $200-400
- **Payback period: ~2 months**

But the real ROI isn't measured in dollars.

It's the visitor who comes back because someone called them Monday instead of never. It's the volunteer who gets plugged in instead of giving up. It's the person with a sick family member who knows their prayer was heard.

---

## Why Now

**AI finally works for handwriting.**

Claude Vision can read messy handwriting on varied card formats—with staff verification—at 95%+ final accuracy. This wasn't possible two years ago.

**Churches are ready to invest.**

Post-COVID, churches are digitizing operations. They're spending on tools that save staff time. The ROI conversation lands differently than it did in 2019.

**Planning Center integration is the unlock.**

Most growing churches already use Planning Center. By integrating directly with their existing system, we eliminate adoption friction. We're not asking them to switch—we're making what they already use work better.

---

## Validation

**Pilot church demo (December 2025):**

> "10-15 hours per week saved is real ROI."

> "Deduplication is the biggest value we see."

> "We need clean data going INTO Planning Center, not a replacement for it."

---

## The Vision

**Every person who fills out a connect card gets a response.**

Not in three weeks. Not if someone remembers. Every single one.

The volunteer who wants to serve gets welcomed and onboarded. The visitor who's checking things out gets a personal follow-up. The person who wrote a prayer request knows it was read, that someone cared, that they weren't just filling out a form that disappeared.

We started this because we've been that person. We don't want anyone else to feel forgotten.

---

## Summary: The Golden Circle

**WHY:** No one should feel forgotten after reaching out to a church. We've been the ones who submitted cards and never heard back. We're building the tool we wish existed.

**HOW:** AI reads handwritten cards in seconds. Smart deduplication keeps data clean. Automation ensures same-day follow-up. Integration with existing church software means no extra work.

**WHAT:** Church Connect Hub—an AI-powered platform that turns paper connect cards into engaged church members.
