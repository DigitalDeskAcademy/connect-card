# Platform Architecture & Vision

This document consolidates the business vision, multi-tenant architecture requirements, and roadmap planning.

## üéØ Business Vision & Context

### Executive Summary

**Sidecar is a simplified UI wrapper over GoHighLevel for IV therapy clinics, providing easy-to-use features without complex GHL training.** Clinics use SideCar features directly instead of learning GoHighLevel's complex interface. We solve the critical problem facing GHL agencies: overwhelming client support demands that prevent agencies from scaling beyond a handful of clients.

**Current Status:** Building GHL wrapper MVP with placeholder pages for testing API integration. Multi-tenant architecture complete. LMS features repositioned as secondary (future agency onboarding tool).

**Product Strategy:** Direct feature usage (not training-based) - Clinics interact with simple, focused interfaces that hide GHL complexity.

**Target Market:** IV therapy clinics served by GoHighLevel agencies (starting with Digital Desk's 15+ clients).

### The Problem We Solve

The platform emerged from real business pain at **Digital Desk** (IV therapy clinic management agency):

- Clients needed constant support for GHL features causing 10+ hours per client monthly
- Manual appointment management and calendar troubleshooting
- Inventory tracking for medical supplies done in spreadsheets
- Support costs preventing agency growth beyond 15 clients
- No unified view of client operations across GHL, calendars, and inventory

**The Universal Challenge**: GHL agencies can't scale because client support demands grow linearly with each new client. Agencies need intelligent automation to deliver exceptional service while reducing manual effort by 80%.

### The Solution: AI-Powered Operations Hub

**Core Value Proposition:**

- **Reduce support time from 10+ hours to 2 hours per client per month**
- Real-time GHL data integration for proactive issue detection
- Calendar and appointment management automation
- Inventory tracking for medical supplies
- AI-powered insights and recommendations (coming Phase 2)

**Business Impact:**

- Agencies can scale from 10 clients to 50+ clients with same team
- Higher profit margins through reduced support overhead
- Better client retention through proactive service
- Revenue growth without proportional cost increases

## üèóÔ∏è Multi-Tenant B2B SaaS Architecture

### Multi-Tenant Architecture (IMPLEMENTED)

**Current State**: Full multi-tenant B2B SaaS platform with organization-based data isolation.

**Business Model**:

- **Sidecar** sells CRM dashboard access to GHL agencies (Platform Customers)
- **Agencies** get isolated environments to manage multiple end clients
- **End Clients** (medical practices) get managed through the agency dashboard
- Each agency has separate GHL API credentials, calendar integrations, and client data

### Technical Architecture (Implemented)

#### Current Database Schema

```typescript
// Core multi-tenant models
Organization {
  id, name, slug, type, domain, website,
  subscriptionStatus, trialEndsAt,
  stripeCustomerId, stripeSubscriptionId
}

User {
  id, email, name, role (platform_admin | agency_owner | agency_admin | user),
  organizationId, emailVerified, stripeCustomerId
}

Member {
  userId, organizationId, role,
  createdAt, updatedAt
}

// GHL Integration (Primary Use Case)
GHLContact {
  id, ghlContactId, organizationId,
  firstName, lastName, email, phone,
  tags, customFields, locationId,
  lastSyncedAt
}

GHLLocation {
  id, ghlLocationId, organizationId,
  name, address, phone, timezone,
  apiKey (encrypted), webhookId
}

// Calendar Integration (Core Feature)
CalendarEvent {
  id, organizationId, contactId,
  calendarProvider (cal.com | calendly | ghl),
  eventType, startTime, endTime,
  status, metadata, syncedAt
}

// Inventory Management (Medical Practices)
InventoryItem {
  id, organizationId, locationId,
  name, sku, category, quantity,
  reorderPoint, cost, supplier
}

InventoryTransaction {
  id, itemId, organizationId,
  type (usage | purchase | adjustment),
  quantity, date, userId, notes
}

// Training Platform (Secondary - Future Academy)
Course {
  id, title, organizationId, userId,
  stripePriceId (optional), isFree,
  status, level, category
}

Invitation {
  id, email, organizationId, role,
  token, status, expiresAt
}
```

#### Authentication System

- **Better Auth** with Email OTP and GitHub OAuth
- **Role-based access control** (UserRole enum)
- **Organization plugin** for multi-tenancy
- **Smart redirects** based on user role and organization

#### Security Requirements

- **Row-Level Security**: All queries filtered by organizationId
- **Route Protection**: API middleware enforces tenant boundaries
- **API Key Isolation**: GHL credentials encrypted per organization
- **File Isolation**: S3 structure: `orgs/{orgId}/files/`
- **Stripe Isolation**: Separate customers per organization

#### Integration Architecture

**GoHighLevel Integration (Primary)**:

- OAuth 2.0 authentication per agency
- Webhook handlers for real-time contact updates
- API polling for locations and opportunities
- Rate limiting and error handling
- Data sync every 15 minutes + webhook updates

**Calendar Integration (Core Feature)**:

- Cal.com API for appointment management
- Event sync with GHL contacts
- Availability management
- Automated reminders and follow-ups
- Multi-location support

**AI Capabilities (Phase 2 - Planned)**:

- Vercel AI SDK integration
- GPT-4 for intelligent insights
- Predictive analytics for client needs
- Automated support ticket triage
- Natural language queries for data

### Data Migration Strategy

1. Create default organization for existing data
2. Update all existing users/courses to reference default org
3. Test data isolation with multiple organizations
4. Deploy with feature flags for gradual rollout
