/**
 * Stripe Webhook Handler - Course Enrollment Activation API
 *
 * This webhook endpoint is CRITICAL for the LMS payment flow, serving as the
 * integration point between Stripe's payment system and the LMS enrollment
 * database. Handles secure payment event processing with comprehensive validation.
 *
 * API Design:
 * - POST /api/webhook/stripe
 * - Content-Type: application/json (raw Stripe event payload)
 * - Authentication: Stripe signature verification (not user sessions)
 * - Idempotent: Safe to retry failed webhook deliveries
 * - Response: HTTP 200 for success, 400/500 for errors
 *
 * Integration Flow:
 * 1. User completes payment on Stripe Checkout session
 * 2. Stripe sends webhook event to this endpoint with signature
 * 3. API verifies webhook signature for authenticity
 * 4. API extracts enrollment metadata from session object
 * 5. API updates enrollment status from "Pending" to "Active"
 * 6. User gains immediate access to course content
 *
 * Webhook Security:
 * - Stripe signature verification prevents unauthorized requests
 * - Raw body parsing required for signature validation
 * - Environment-based webhook secret for signature checking
 * - Signature verification failure returns HTTP 400
 *
 * Event Processing:
 * - Currently handles: checkout.session.completed
 * - Future support: invoice.payment_failed, customer.subscription.deleted
 * - Metadata extraction: courseId, enrollmentId, customerId
 * - Database transaction: Updates enrollment with payment details
 *
 * Error Handling:
 * - 400: Invalid signature or malformed webhook payload
 * - 500: Database errors, missing metadata, or processing failures
 * - Stripe retries failed webhooks with exponential backoff
 * - Critical errors should be monitored and alerted
 *
 * âœ… PRODUCTION SECURITY FIXES - COMPLETED:
 * 1. âœ… Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP responses
 * 2. âœ… Structured logging for webhook verification failures and success events
 * 3. âœ… Payment status verification (checks session.payment_status === "paid")
 * 4. âœ… Database transaction safety for atomic enrollment operations
 * 5. âœ… Correct amount handling (cents to dollars conversion: amount / 100)
 * 6. âœ… Enhanced metadata validation and security checks
 * 7. âœ… Proper error responses without system architecture exposure
 * 8. âœ… Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging
 *
 * Production Ready Features:
 * âœ… Database transactions for atomic enrollment updates
 * âœ… Payment status verification before activation
 * âœ… Comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP responses
 * âœ… Structured logging for successful and failed enrollments
 * âœ… Proper amount conversion from cents to dollars
 * âœ… Enhanced metadata validation and security measures
 * ðŸ”„ TODO: Support additional Stripe events (invoice.payment_failed, etc.)
 * ðŸ”„ TODO: Webhook retry handling and idempotency considerations
 *
 * Integration Dependencies:
 * - Stripe webhook endpoint configuration in dashboard
 * - Webhook signing secret environment variable
 * - Database schema with enrollment status management
 * - Customer ID linking between Stripe and user accounts
