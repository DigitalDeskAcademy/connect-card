/**
 * Better Auth API Routes with Arcjet Security Protection
 *
 * This file implements the central authentication API for the application using Better Auth
 * with comprehensive security protection via Arcjet. All authentication flows (login, signup,
 * OAuth, email verification) are handled through these endpoints.
 *
 * Security Architecture:
 * - Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks and spam
 * - Bot detection to block automated abuse
 * - Email validation to prevent disposable/invalid email addresses
 * - IP-based and user-based rate limiting
 * - CSRF protection through Better Auth's built-in mechanisms
 * - Session management with secure cookies (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
 *
 * Threat Model Protection:
 * - Brute Force: Rate limiting (5 attempts per 2 minutes)
 * - Bot Attacks: Automated bot detection and blocking
 * - Email Abuse: Disposable email detection and validation
 * - Account Enumeration: Generic error messages
 * - Session Hijacking: Secure cookie configuration
 * - CSRF: SameSite cookies and origin validation
 *
 * Performance Considerations:
 * - Arcjet rules cached for optimal performance
 * - User-based rate limiting for authenticated requests
 * - IP fallback for anonymous requests
 * - Request cloning for body inspection (signup protection)
 *
 * @route GET|POST /api/auth/[...all] - Handles all Better Auth endpoints
