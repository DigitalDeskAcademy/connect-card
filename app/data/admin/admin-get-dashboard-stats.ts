 * - Real-time data aggregation with efficient database queries
 *
 * Security Architecture:
 * - Requires admin authentication via requireAdmin() guard
 * - Server-only execution prevents client-side data exposure
 * - Role-based access control for sensitive analytics data
 * - Prisma type safety and SQL injection prevention
 *
 * Performance Optimizations:
 * - Parallel query execution reduces database round trips
 * - Efficient Prisma relations with selective field loading
 * - Calculated aggregations minimize database processing
 * - Fallback values prevent undefined state rendering
 * - Optimized WHERE clauses and proper indexing strategy
 *
 * Data Architecture:
 * - Uses enrollment status as proxy for completion tracking
 * - Course/chapter hierarchy analysis for content insights
 * - Time-based calculations for engagement patterns
 * - Statistical methods for meaningful analytics presentation
 *
 * Scalability Considerations:
 * - Query patterns optimized for large dataset performance
 * - Proper database indexing on frequently queried fields
