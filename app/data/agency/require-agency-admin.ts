/**
 * Church Admin Authentication & Authorization Guard
 *
 * Provides enterprise-grade multi-tenant security using Better Auth's organization plugin:
 * 1. Organization validation (exists and active)
 * 2. Session and active organization verification
 * 3. Member role-based access control
 * 4. Subscription status validation
 *
 * Security Model:
 * - Validates organization exists and is active
 * - Verifies session has activeOrganizationId matching the requested org
 * - Checks user's member role in the organization
 * - Validates subscription status
 * - Returns session, organization, and member data for context
