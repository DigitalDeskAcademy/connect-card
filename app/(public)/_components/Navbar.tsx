/**
 * Navigation Bar - Primary site navigation and conversion optimization
 *
 * Global navigation component that provides consistent site-wide navigation,
 * authentication-aware user experience, and conversion-optimized call-to-action
 * placement. Adapts intelligently based on user authentication status and role.
 *
 * Business Objectives:
 * - Guide users through optimal conversion paths based on authentication state
 * - Provide seamless navigation between marketing and application areas
 * - Reduce friction in user authentication and account management
 * - Establish consistent branding and trust through professional design
 * - Drive trial signups and course enrollment through strategic CTA placement
 *
 * User Experience Strategy:
 * - Role-based navigation: Different menu items for admin vs regular users
 * - Authentication state awareness: Dynamic CTAs based on login status
 * - Progressive disclosure: Show relevant options without overwhelming
 * - Visual hierarchy: Logo → Navigation → Actions flows naturally left-to-right
 * - Accessibility: Proper semantic markup and keyboard navigation support
 *
 * Conversion Optimization Features:
 * - Dual CTA strategy for unauthenticated users (Login + Free Trial)
 * - Strategic placement of "Free Trial" as primary action
 * - Clear visual distinction between secondary (Login) and primary (Free Trial) actions
 * - Sticky positioning maintains CTAs visibility during scroll
 * - Theme toggle for user preference and engagement
 *
 * Navigation Logic:
 * - Admin Users: Admin-focused navigation with dashboard access
 * - Regular Users: Customer-focused navigation with marketing pages
 * - Unauthenticated: Marketing navigation with clear conversion paths
 * - Smart logo linking: Home for regular users, admin dashboard for admins
 *
 * Technical Implementation:
 * - Client-side authentication state management with Better Auth
 * - Responsive design with mobile-first approach
 * - Backdrop blur and transparency for modern glass morphism effect
 * - Sticky positioning (top-0 z-50) for persistent navigation access
 * - Optimized image loading with Next.js Image component
 *
 * Performance Considerations:
 * - Minimal JavaScript footprint with optimized auth state checking
 * - Efficient re-rendering only when authentication state changes
 * - Lazy-loaded user avatar images with fallback generation
 * - CSS-based responsive behavior for fast mobile performance
 *
 * @component Navbar
 * @returns {JSX.Element} Complete navigation bar with authentication state
 *
 * @example
 * // Automatically included in PublicLayout for all public pages
 * <Navbar />
 *
 * // Navigation adapts based on user state:
 * // - Unauthenticated: Marketing nav + Login/Free Trial CTAs
 * // - Regular User: Course nav + User dropdown
 * // - Admin: Admin nav + Dashboard access + User dropdown

/**
 * Navigation Bar Component
 *
 * Renders the main site navigation with role-based menu items, authentication-aware
 * actions, and conversion-optimized call-to-action buttons. Provides consistent
 * branding and user experience across all public pages.
 *
 * Authentication Flow:
 * 1. Fetches user session state using Better Auth client hook
 * 2. Renders different navigation items based on user role (admin vs regular)
 * 3. Shows appropriate authentication actions (login/trial vs user dropdown)
 * 4. Handles loading states gracefully during authentication checks
 *
 * Navigation Strategy:
 * - Admin users get admin-focused navigation with dashboard and analytics access
 * - Regular users get customer-focused navigation with marketing pages
 * - All users can access the courses catalog for browsing and enrollment
 * - Smart routing based on user context and business objectives
 *
 * @component Navbar
 * @returns {JSX.Element} Navigation bar with role-based menu and auth actions
