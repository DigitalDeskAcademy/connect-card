# Church Connect Card Management System

**Multi-tenant platform for churches to digitize connect cards and manage member engagement**

Transform paper connect cards into actionable member data with automated OCR scanning, intelligent data extraction, and comprehensive church management tools.

---

## Overview

Church Connect Card System helps churches eliminate manual data entry and improve visitor follow-up by:

- **Digitize Connect Cards** - Scan or upload photos of paper connect cards
- **Automated Data Extraction** - OCR technology extracts names, emails, phone numbers, prayer requests
- **Member Management** - Track visitors, members, and engagement
- **Church Training** - Built-in course system for staff and volunteer training

### Current Status: MVP Development

We're building the foundation with multi-tenant authentication, database setup, and core infrastructure. Connect card scanning with OCR integration is next.
