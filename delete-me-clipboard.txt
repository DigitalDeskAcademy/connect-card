● The Architecture Problem You've Identified

  You're absolutely right - this is a massive 
  scalability issue! Currently:

  Current Architecture (Duplicated Everything):

  /platform/admin/page.tsx        → Platform Admin
  Dashboard
  /agency/[slug]/admin/page.tsx   → Agency Admin
  Dashboard
  /agency/[slug]/learning/page.tsx → End User
  Dashboard

  Each is a separate file with potentially duplicate
   code!

  The Problem at Scale:

  If you want to add a "System Announcement Banner"
  that all users should see:
  - You'd need to add it in 3 different dashboard 
  files
  - Want to add a "New Feature Tour"? 3 places
  - Want to add "Holiday notification"? 3 places
  - Want to change the layout? 3 places

  Common Solutions in Industry:

  Option 1: Unified Dashboard with Role-Based 
  Components

  // Single /dashboard/page.tsx
  export default async function Dashboard() {
    const user = await getUser();

    return (
      <>
        {/* Shared components for ALL roles */}
        <SystemAnnouncement />
        <WelcomeHeader user={user} />

        {/* Role-specific components */}
        {user.role === 'platform_admin' &&
  <PlatformAdminDashboard />}
        {user.role === 'agency_admin' &&
  <AgencyAdminDashboard />}
        {user.role === 'user' &&
  <UserLearningDashboard />}
      </>
    );
  }

  Option 2: Composition Pattern (Better)

  // Shared dashboard layout
  function DashboardLayout({ children }) {
    return (
      <div>
        <SystemAnnouncement />  {/* Shown to
  everyone */}
        <Header />               {/* Shown to
  everyone */}
        <Sidebar />              {/* Role-aware
  sidebar */}
        {children}               {/* Role-specific
  content */}
      </div>
    );
  }

  // Then each role dashboard uses the layout
  <DashboardLayout>
    <PlatformAdminContent />
  </DashboardLayout>

  Option 3: Feature Flags (Most Flexible)

  // Central feature configuration
  const features = {
    announcement: { enabled: true, roles: ['all'] },
    analytics: { enabled: true, roles:
  ['platform_admin', 'agency_admin'] },
    learning: { enabled: true, roles: ['user'] },
    billing: { enabled: true, roles:
  ['platform_admin', 'agency_owner'] }
  };

  The Real Issue:

  Your codebase has role-based routing but not
  component composition. This leads to:
  - Massive duplication (889 lines for course
  creation!)
  - Maintenance nightmare (fix bugs in 3 places)
  - Inconsistent UX (one dashboard gets updated,
  others forgotten)

  What Successful Companies Do:

  - Stripe Dashboard: Single dashboard, features
  shown based on permissions
  - Vercel: Unified dashboard with project/team
  context switching
  - GitHub: One interface, features enabled by
  plan/role

  The solution isn't just fixing the Cancel button -
   it's establishing a composition pattern where
  shared UI is written once and role-specific
  features are composed in!


  Ok,lets discuss based on our goals a plan to get 
  this right. Outside of starting all over, I want the
   plan that suits what we are building, Id like to 
  use industry standards. Create a comprehensive 
  review of what we would need to change. The level of
   complexity, and how this aligns with our platform 
  we are building. Im looking for straight forward 
  answers, dont be agreeable, be an expert leading 
  this project.
